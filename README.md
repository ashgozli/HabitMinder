# Open Source Habit Tracking App :iphone:
This is a habit tracking app that allows users to login/sign up using Firebase Authentication and keep track of their habits using Firestore, a cloud database. Users can add new habits, mark them as complete or incomplete, and track their progress over time.

# Google Developer's Student Club ‚öõÔ∏è
This open source project is organized by the 2022-2023 Tech Team at UBC Google Developer's Student Club including [Mayank Rastogi], [Ashkan Gharahgozli], and [Andrew Lee], with the goal of teaching GDSC members full stack React Native development.
